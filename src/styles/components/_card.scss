// SCSS allows you to write css programmatically as if styles were an object. The level here would be the same as
// writing two styles in css for .card > .card-text, but instead you can nest them in the original .card styles
// That way all the styles from .card get applied to the other levels of styles.
.card {
  color: #434c50;
  max-width: 20rem;

  .card-img-top {
    background-color: #eef2f2;
  }

  .card-text {
    font-size: 1rem;
